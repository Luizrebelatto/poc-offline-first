# Offline-First Todo App with WatermelonDB

This is a React Native Todo application that implements offline-first architecture using WatermelonDB. The app works seamlessly both online and offline, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

## What is Offline-First?

Offline-first is an architecture pattern where the application is designed to work primarily offline, with synchronization as a secondary concern. Key benefits include:

- Works without internet connection
- Instant response to user actions
- Automatic background synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- Better user experience in poor network conditions

## WatermelonDB Overview

WatermelonDB is a powerful local database for React Native applications that provides:

- SQLite-based storage
- Observable queries
- Offline-first architecture
- TypeScript support
- Automatic synchronization capabilities

## Architecture

### 1. Database Structure
```typescript
// Schema definition
{
  name: 'todos',
  columns: [
    { name: 'text', type: 'string' },
    { name: 'completed', type: 'boolean' },
    { name: 'created_at', type: 'number' },
    { name: 'updated_at', type: 'number' },
    { name: 'server_id', type: 'string', isOptional: true },
    { name: 'is_synced', type: 'boolean' }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Data Flow
```
User Action → Local DB → Mark as Unsynced → Background Sync → Server
```

### 3. Sync Process
1. Local changes are marked with `isSynced: false`
2. Background sync process runs every 30 seconds
3. Unsynced changes are pushed to server
4. Server changes are pulled and merged locally
5. Conflicts are resolved using timestamps

## Key Features

- **Instant Local Updates**: All changes are saved locally first
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization in the background
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles conflicts using timestamp comparison
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet connection
- **Visual Sync Status**: Shows sync status in the UI
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

## How It Works

### 1. Creating a Todo
```typescript
// Local creation
await todosCollection.create(todo => {
  todo.text = "New Todo";
  todo.completed = false;
  todo.isSynced = false; // Mark for sync
});
```

### 2. Updating a Todo
```typescript
// Local update
await todo.update(record => {
  record.completed = true;
  record.isSynced = false; // Mark for sync
});
```

### 3. Syncing Changes
```typescript
// Sync process
const localChanges = await todosCollection
  .query(Q.where('is_synced', false))
  .fetch();

// Push to server
for (const todo of localChanges) {
  await api.updateTodo(todo.serverId, {
    text: todo.text,
    completed: todo.completed
  });
}
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Performance**
   - Instant response to user actions
   - No waiting for network requests
   - Smooth user experience

2. **Reliability**
   - Works in poor network conditions
   - No data loss during network issues
   - Automatic recovery when online

3. **User Experience**
   - No loading states for basic operations
   - Background sync doesn't block UI
   - Clear sync status indication

4. **Development**
   - Type-safe database operations
   - Observable queries for reactive updates
   - Easy to test and maintain

## Best Practices

1. **Always work locally first**
   - Save changes to local database immediately
   - Mark changes as unsynced
   - Let sync process handle server communication

2. **Handle conflicts properly**
   - Use timestamps for conflict resolution
   - Implement proper merge strategies
   - Consider user intent in conflicts

3. **Provide feedback**
   - Show sync status to users
   - Indicate when changes are pending sync
   - Handle sync errors gracefully

4. **Optimize sync process**
   - Batch changes when possible
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Consider network conditions

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install @nozbe/watermelondb
```

2. Set up database schema and models
3. Implement sync service
4. Use WatermelonDB's observable queries for reactive updates

## Conclusion

This offline-first architecture with WatermelonDB provides a robust foundation for building reliable mobile applications that work seamlessly both online and offline. The combination of local-first operations and background synchronization ensures a great user experience while maintaining data consistency across devices.
